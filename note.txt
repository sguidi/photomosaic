Image not resizable means last column/row may be of smaller size than the tile
    a - Render for them a normal size svg tile => mosaic image will not respect the original size
    b - css resize the svg tile, those tiles will look smallers but original size is respected

Tech solution:
    tiles worker will accept the image as buffer, see Worker Transferable Objects
        returned tiles matching HEX , singles (terminator) or row block

    fetcher worker will retrieve the svg from the server based on hex
        caching result SVG to skip calls of matching hex
        append SVGs node as single DOM write per row (or smaller DOM injection keeping the row hidden until completed)
